## What This Is

This project aims to create a **data-driven phrasebook for programmers** — a ranked collection of the 200–500 most common JavaScript and TypeScript code patterns found in real-world projects.

Just as a language learner studies high-frequency phrases like “Where is the bathroom?” or “How much does this cost?”, this phrasebook will capture the most frequent and useful “idioms” in JS/TS — the true **vocabulary of modern programming practice**.

To build this, we’ll **analyze large numbers of open-source repositories** and **extract JavaScript-related files** — including `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` — to study how developers actually write and structure their code in the wild.

The end result will be a ranked list of recurring syntax and structure patterns — things like `array.map(item => item.property)`, `addEventListener(...)`, `async/await` usage, destructuring patterns, and more — drawn from real codebases rather than tutorials.

## Why It Matters

Most developers learn *syntax*, not *frequency*. Tutorials show what’s possible, but not what’s **common** or **worth mastering first**.
This project aims to change that by grounding learning in real-world usage data.

* **Beginners** will know which 50–100 patterns matter most — the ones that appear in nearly every project.
* **Experienced developers** will see which idioms dominate modern codebases and where trends are shifting.
* **Educators** will have a data-backed foundation for teaching the patterns that truly define today’s JavaScript and TypeScript.

By mapping the most frequent building blocks across thousands of real repositories, this phrasebook will turn code analysis into practical insight — showing *what developers actually write*, not just *what they could*.
